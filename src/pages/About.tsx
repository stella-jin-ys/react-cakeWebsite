          At Munamii Cakery, every cake and box of cupcakes we make has a very
          special value for us. We don't just want to bring a dessert to your
          table, but rather a unique experience for you, which will become an
          unforgettable memory. We have been in the pastry market for more than
          8 years and now we offer you a new way to buy through our website.
